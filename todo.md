# To do
Here is a list of items that need to be addressed for a better UX.

##Security
- [x] Should we remove CDNs and external links?
 - Yeah it may be a little paranoid
- [ ] Better CryptoJS integration.
 - Oh god.
- [x] Creat obfuscation bots.

##UI Fixes
- [x] Fix return issue for textarea.chatInput
 - Look for solution in app.js keyCode in app.js
 - Be sure not to loose the if ((keyCode == 10 || keyCode == 13) && e.ctrlKey) functionality.
- [x] Decrypted and Encrypted chat windows are not appropriately using scrollHeight
- [ ] The progress bar in passstrong.js is just showing colors like a stop sign. Not good enough.
 - Also where are the bootstrap stripes?
- [ ] Fix ui jumping to bottom when scrolling up through chat.

##Content
- [ ] Confrim the README.md file is reading in a sensible and easily to understand way.
- [ ] Copy edit all text.
